        <p>-   
          The Promil® Gifted Brain Room is an immersive experience inspired by escape rooms – designed in partnership with Mystery Manila, we challenge Gifted Kids to take on the journey and see their Gifted Brain in action while taking on puzzles that highlight focus, memory, language, and problem solving.

          The main goal is to travel inside the Gifted Brain, collect the four nutrients, and put them altogether to help nurture a Gifted Brain and soon, raise a whole new generation of Gifted Kids!

        <h2>ESCAPE ROOM MECHANICS</h2>
        <hr>
          <h4>How many can play? 
          </h4>
          <p>- Only 6 persons max are allowed inside the Gifted Brain Room, with a maximum of 2 guardians and 4 kids.
          </p>
          <h4>How long is the mission inside the escape room? 
            </h4>
          <p>- The mission must be completed within a maximum of 20 minutes only. 
          </p>
          <h4>What if we don't complete the mission in the given time? 
            </h4>
          <p>- The mission must be completed within 20 minutes, but if you are unable to do so, you can try again and rebook for another time.
          </p>
          <h4>Can I get a clue or seek help during the mission?
          </h4>
          <p>- Of course! All you need to do is shout <b>“Gordon, help!”</b> and Gordon will give you a clue. Please note that every time you ask for a clue, 1 minute will be added to your total solving time. <b>(1 clue = +1 minute)</b>
            </p>
          <h4>
            What if we suddenly don’t feel well or have concerns in the middle of the mission?
          </h4>
          <p>- You can call out to our Game Masters if you have any concerns while inside the Gifted Brain Room. They'll come in to assist you!
          </p>
          <h4>
            What if we need to take a bathroom break in the middle of the mission?
          </h4>
          <p>- Before we proceed to the viewing room, we will encourage you to do your bathroom breaks since we discourage leaving the escape room once the mission has started. 
          </p>
          <h4>What if we REALLY need to take a bathroom break in the middle of the mission?</h4>
          <p>- Just call out to our Game Masters to let them know and they will direct you to the nearest restroom. Please note that your solving time will continue to run even while you are on break, and you will be required to remove the Gifted Brain Visualizer. This will result to an inaccurate reading of your child's Gifted Brain.</p>
          <h4>What if there's an emergency and we suddenly need to leave in the middle of the mission? </h4>
          <p>- No worries! Just call out to our Game Masters and they'll help you exit the escape room. However, the timer will be stopped completely and you will need to rebook if you want to try the mission again.</p>
          <h4>What if we have friends or family who do not want to join the escape room but still want to stay inside the Promil® Gifted Brain Room?</h4>
          <p>- We can allow kids who are 3 to 7 years old and legal guardians who are 18 years old and above to stay inside the premises of the Promil® Gifted Brain Room (ex. Free play area). In compliance with the milk code and to ensure safety, we cannot allow pregnant women inside any premises of the Promil® Gifted Brain Room.</p>
          <h4>What if my child and I don't want to play alone? Can we merge with other groups instead?</h4>
          <p>- We understand that it may be more fun to play with a big group! However, we encourage you to play with someone you know well. Please note that we also do not allow any child to join the mission unsupervised by a legal guardian.</p>

          <p>- It is possible to remove the device in the middle of the mission, but please note that this will result in an inaccurate reading of your child’s Gifted Brain.</p>
