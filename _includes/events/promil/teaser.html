                            Gifted Kids, you have been tasked to go on a mission to discover the secrets and untold mysteries of a Gifted Brain!
                            <br><br>
                            With Gordonâ€™s help, you will need to collect four nutrient disks: DHA, Lutein, Choline, and MOS+.
                            Each nutrient is important in nurturing a Gifted Brain! DHA & MOS+ helps to support brain function, Choline helps with memory and thinking, while Lutein improves visual and cognitive development.
                            <br><br>
                            To collect these nutrients, you must go through different challenges that will test your focus, memory, language, and problem solving.
                            <br><br>
                            Complete the mission by putting the four nutrients together so that more Gifted Brains will be nurtured and soon raise a whole new generation of Gifted Kids, just like you!
                            <br><br>
                            Good luck, Gifted Kids!
