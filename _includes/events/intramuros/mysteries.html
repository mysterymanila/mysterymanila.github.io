                In 1942, the Filipino people grieved for the loss of Father Gomez. He was said to be the only priest who could drive out spirits and demons from oneâ€™s body. When the Japanese colony knew about his special ability, they took him away and killed him.
                
                A few weeks after the death, people have been seeing him around Intramuros. But something was different, Father Gomez had a different voice, was uncontrollable, and looks very ill.
