              <p>

                If your 50 minutes is up and you haven’t solved the mystery, you have the option of trying it again at a discounted rate. This will be subject to booking availability.

      <h3>

        Can I get a clue or seek help during the game?

        Yes but every clue requested will equate to a penalty of 5 minute addition to your total solving time.

        </h3>

         What if I really want to play alone?
       </h3>
       <p>

         Depending on the mystery, you can play alone if you really want to but you have to pay for the price of two players. The mysteries are designed to be solved by at least two players and a maximum of 5. We believe that it is better and much more fun to solve mysteries together.
