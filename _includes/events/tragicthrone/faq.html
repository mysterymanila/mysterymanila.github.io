            What if I really want to play alone?
          </h3>
          <p>
    
            Depending on the mystery, you can play alone if you really want to but you have to pay for the price of two players. The mysteries are designed to be solved by at least two players and a maximum of 5. We believe that it is better and much more fun to solve mysteries together.
