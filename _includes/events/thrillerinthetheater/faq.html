            <p>
  
                Paid bookings cannot be refunded but may be transferred to a different date/time slot subject to our rebooking fees and policies.
                
     
    No refunds will be given if the number of the initial group booked is lesser than the ones who will actually play. 
     
    Time and date changes made to any confirmed booking will be subject for approval and availability of the new chosen time as well as additional charges. Below is the table of fees depending on when the booking change request is made: 

    <table class="table">
        <thead>
            <th>Condition</th>
            <th>Rebooking Fee</th>
        </thead>
        <tbody>

                <td>PHP 700.00</td>

                HOW LONG IS THE GAME:
              </h3>
              <p>
                The game will be around 30 to 45 minutes long depending on your team.
              </p>

                  What happens if I don't get to solve it? 
                </h3>
                <p>
  
                  If your time is up and you haven’t solved the mystery, you have the option of trying it again at a discounted rate. This will be subject to booking availability.
                </p>
          <h3>
    
            Can I get a clue or seek help during the game?
          </h3>
          <p>    
            Yes. There will be a gamekeeper who will be with you the entire time. The gamekeeper will not intervene at any point unless requested to do so. If you ask for a clue, the gamekeeper will provide you with it but every clue requested will equate to a 5 minute addition to your final time. The more  clues you ask for, the more time that will be added to your final finishing time. You will have a fixed amount of 30 minutes maximum to play the game.
          </p>
          <h3>
    
            Age limit: 
            </h3>
          <p>
    
              Groups with minors below 18 years old should be accompanied by at least 1 adult.
          </p>
          <h3>
    
            What if I'm late for the game? Will time be deducted?:
            </h3>
          <p>
    
            If you are less than 5 minutes late, we will still accommodate you with your original booking
            schedule. However if you are late for more than 5 minutes, you can still proceed with the game
            upon arrival but your time allotted to solve the mystery will be reduced. For example, if your
            booking schedule is at 1pm until 1:30pm and you arrive at 1:10pm, you can still proceed with
            the game but your time inside the room will only be 25 minutes instead of 30 minutes.
          </p>
          <h3>
    
            What happens if I solve the Mystery?
          </h3>
          <p>
                The sole objective of the activity is for you to have an unforgettable experience and to try something new and challenging by solving the mystery or by working your way through riddles to escape from the theater.
