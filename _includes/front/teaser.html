                        Mystery Manila is an activity that allows people to try something new and challenging. You have
                        several mysteryies to choose from. Each mystery will be represented by a room that transports
                        you to that location and scenario. The simulation is as realistic as it can get and you'll be
                        given all the things that you need to solve the mystery. It's up to you to figure out how to use
                        these things and clues to solve the mystery in less than 60 minutes.
