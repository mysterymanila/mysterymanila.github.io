Another instance was when he was given a heavy blow to his ear causing his eardrum to bleed. He was wondering why his step dad won't kill him so that the pain ends then and there...<br><br>But then, like a small light at the end of the tunnel, he had a reason to hope. He thought of escaping the wretched place. He became alive, and decided to survive."
