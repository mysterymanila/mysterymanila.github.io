      Privacy Centre & Privacy Policy
      MYSTERY MANILA -  A Trade Name under the company 360 Aevent Management Corp respects the privacy rights of our users and is strongly committed to protecting your privacy online. Our privacy policy, along with controls to manage data we collect are below.
      Use of Cookies and Similar Technologies
      MYSTERY MANILA makes use of cookies and similar technologies (particularly HTML5 local storage) to give you a better experience with this website. A cookie is a small text file that is stored within your browser, and passed back to the server every time a page is requested. This allows websites to differentiate between users, or serve different content depending on what values are in the cookie. HTML5 local storage is a way for websites to store small amounts of data in your browser that can only be read client-side, unless the site contains code to send data from local storage back to the server.
      The MYSTERY MANILA website makes use of HTML5 local storage as a cache, so that it can quickly display Alerts settings, use your User ID, and remember your authentication token between browser sessions (ie. if you leave this site or close your browser and open it again, you won't need to log in again). 
       
      Your User ID
      If you are logged into the MYSTERY MANILA website, you will have a User ID. This ID is a number that the MYSTERY MANILA website uses internally to quickly match your account to your details, subscriptions you have enabled, as well as your settings. This User ID will also be transmitted to Google Analytics if (and only if) you are logged in, however it is not identifiable unless matched against our internal accounts database, which is not shared with any third parties. If you visit the Route Maps tab on MYSTERY MANILA Profiles, your User ID will be encrypted and transmitted to OAG, who then transmit the encrypted token back to us in order to verify that your account has the appropriate access. OAG have no knowledge of your User ID during this entire process.
       
      Data Collection
      MYSTERY MANILA makes use of several technologies to collect data from you as you use the website. They are detailed below. The data collected by these tools is only directly viewable to MYSTERY MANILA and the companies hosting the analytics tools, however it may be disclosed in an anonymous, broad aggregate format in certain situations (ie. a potential advertising client would want to know how many views per month our website gets).
      Google Analytics
      MYSTERY MANILA uses the industry-standard Google Analytics platform to collect data related to how users are using the site. We use this data in an aggregated form in order to figure out overall site traffic, which types of content are performing well, how long users spend on the site, how long pages take to load, how various marketing campaigns have performed and so on. This data is anonymous, unless you are logged into the site. When logged into the website (and only when logged into the website), your User ID is transmitted to Google Analytics and your activity will be linked to that ID. MYSTERY MANILA can then potentially use that data to identify the product usage of individual users and companies. Agreeing to this tracking is part of the Terms of Service for MYSTERY MANILA Membership and other products.
      Act-On
      MYSTERY MANILA make use of a third-party analytics tool called Act-On. Similar details to Google Analytics are stored, however once you fill in a contact form or sign up for a product, all your previous usage of the site will be instantly associated with your identity. Act-On is used by our marketing team in order to determine how successful marketing campaigns have been, and also to get an idea of what type of content an individual user or company finds relevant and useful.
       
      Crash Data
      The MYSTERY MANILA website is an extremely complex Javascript application, and like all computer applications, it has bugs. There are rare occasions where a data tool or other website feature will cause the website to break in your browser. When this happens, the screen will change to a page that indicates that the site has crashed, and will ask if you'd like to send a message stating what you were doing, for troubleshooting purposes. If you consent to automatic crash data collection, that page will still appear when something breaks, but relevant details will be automatically submitted to MYSTERY MANILA. You can still add a message if you wish (and please do, they're very helpful).
      Data collected when a crash occurs:
      URL - the web page address that the crash occurred on. This helps us quickly narrow the scope of possible crash causes.
      Error Type - this is the type of the Javascript error, as reported by your browser. It will be something like "TypeError: Cannot read property 'years' of undefined."
      Error Details - this will contain a list of components that the error occurred within. Due to minification, this list usually isn't helpful, but sometimes it has helped us quickly get to the bottom of where an error is occuring.
      Browser Type - the web browser user-agent string. For your current browser it would be Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_14_0) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/69.0.3497.100 Safari/537.36. We use this to determine whether the bug only affects one brand/version of web browser.
      Page History - this is a list of the previous pages of the MYSTERY MANILA website you were on in the current browser tab during the leadup to the crash occuring. Pages from outside the MYSTERY MANILA site are not included in this list. We use it to troubleshoot whether something on a previous page triggered a bug that caused a crash on the next page.
      User ID - if you are logged into the MYSTERY MANILA website, your user ID will be transmitted. This helps us figure out whether it was a particular setting you had under your account that caused the crash.
      Message - if you've included any message in the crash data submission, this would be it. Note that automatic crash data submission doesn't contain a message.
      Crash data is very helpful for our development team when it comes to troubleshooting and fixing bugs with the site. Previously we've used it to solve crash bugs with the financial graphs, traffic graphs, route maps, the Alerts sidebar and many other things.
       
      Videos
      MYSTERY MANILA and live streaming videos are hosted on third-party websites (Youtube) and displayed via inline frames. Anonymous usage data is tracked for these videos, including the length of time the video was played for, whether or not the video was played, the type of device the user was using, and their location (specific to a country/territory level). This data may also be logged by the video hosting provider for their own internal statistics. Please check their privacy policies for more information on what they do with collected data.
