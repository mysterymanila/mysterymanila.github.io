- question: What is Mystery Manila?
  answer: > 
    Mystery Manila is an activity that allows people to try something new and challenging. You have several mysteries to choose from. Each mystery will be represented by a room that transports you to that location and scenario. The simulation is as realistic as it can get and you'll be given all the things that you need to solve the mystery. It's up to you to figure out how to use these things and clues to solve the mystery in less than 50 minutes.

- question: What happens if I solve the Mystery?
  answer: >
    The sole objective of the activity is for you to have an unforgettable experience and to try something new and challenging by solving the mystery or by working your way through riddles to escape from the room (depending on which mystery you choose). Other than the fulfilling accomplishment from solving the mystery, you will get a special prize depending on the amount of time you solve it. The quicker you solve it, the better the prize. But again, the prizes are just secondary. It's all about the experience and overcoming the challenges.

- question: What happens if I don't get to solve it?
  answer: > 
    If your 50 minutes is up and you haven't escaped or solved the mystery, you have the option of trying it again at a discounted rate. This will be subject to booking availability.

- question: How many can play?
  answer: > 
    Depending on the mystery chosen, your group can play with a minimum of 2/3 up to a maximum of 6.

- question: What if I have tried and solved mysteries for both branches already? When will the next new mysteries be available?
  answer: > 
    Mystery Manila will be coming up with new mysteries regularly. The exact dates will be finalized by the team but rest assured, Mystery Manila will keep on producing mysteries that will keep you on your toes.

- question: Can I get a clue or seek help during the game?
  answer: > 
    Yes. There will be a designated game keeper for each room who will be with you the entire time. The gamekeeper will not intervene at any point unless requested to do so. If you ask for a clue, the gamekeeper will provide you with it but every clue requested will equate to a 5 minute addition to your final time. The more clues you ask for, the more time that will be added to your final finishing time. You will have a fixed amount of 50 minutes maximum to play the game.

- question: What does the mystery room look like?
  answer: > 
    Depending on the mystery chosen, the room you enter will be a specific location or scenario that comprises the mystery. There will be clues, riddles, and pieces of evidence and other elements that you will put together to solve the mystery. Once you enter the room, you'll be transported to that place and time. It's a total experience!

- question: How much is the game?

        </tbody>
    </table>

- question: How long is the game?
  answer: > 
    Each game is an hour and a half long. There will be a 15 minute briefing prior to entering the room, 50 minutes to play the game inside the room, and 15 minutes after the game for debriefing. The briefing and debriefing with the gamekeeper will take place outside of the mystery room.

- question: Can I change my booking?
  answer: >
    Yes but bookings are non refundable and may be transferred to other players. 
     
    No refunds will be given if the number of the initial group booked is lesser than the ones who will actually play. 
     
    Time and date changes made to any confirmed booking will be subject for approval and availability of the new chosen time as well as additional charges. Below is the table of fees depending on when the booking change request is made: 

    <table class="table">
        <thead>
            <th>Condition</th>
            <th>Rebooking Fee</th>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>48 hours or more before the original schedule</td>
                <td>PHP 500.00</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Less than 48 hours up to 24 hours before the original schedule</td>
                <td>PHP 700.00</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>24 hrs and below/no show/booking time has passed</td>
                <td>NO REBOOKING ALLOWED. The slot will be considered played</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

- question: What is the minimum age requirement for players?
  answer: >
    Depending on the mystery chosen, there are some that require you to be 18 years old and above. If minors will be playing, there has to be at least one adult playing with them inside the room. Please read the full description of each mystery before booking.

- question: What if I am late for the game?
  answer: > 
    If you are less than 15 minutes late, we will still accommodate you with your original booking schedule. However if you are late for more than 15 minutes, you can still proceed with the game upon arrival but your time allotted to solve the mystery will be reduced. For example, if your booking schedule is at 10 am until 1130 am and you arrive at 1030 am, you can still proceed with the game but your time inside the room will only be 45 minutes instead of 50 minutes since there will be a briefing of about 15 minutes before the game.

- question: What if I really want to play alone?
  answer: > 
    Depending on the mystery, you can play alone if you really want to but you have to pay for the price of two players. The mysteries are designed to be solved by at least two players and a maximum of six. We believe that it is better and much more fun to solve mysteries together.

- question: What if we booked already but something comes up and we can't go to the game?
  answer: > 
    Since booking and confirming your slot makes that specific slot unavailable for other customers, we cannot refund paid booking/s. You can however, transfer your booking to your family or friends who can play on your behalf.

- question: What if someone who already played the game gives me answers to the mysteries? Wouldn't that spoil the experience?
  answer: >
    Who likes spoilers right? We have to admit that there are some out there who just can't wait to give you the answers or tips on how to solve the mystery. We at Mystery Manila will make sure that each game is a unique experience for every customer even if you play the same mystery. Clues are changed, suspects are replaced, and locations and riddles are mixed up. So if you've played and solved a mystery, don't try to be Sherlock and claim you know the answers. Let your friends enjoy the experience on their own.
