- question: What are the minimum and maximum number of players?
  answer: > 
  We require a minimum of 5 players and a maximum of 15 players. But if you’re a much bigger group than this, let us know so we can see if we can customize something for your group.

- question: How much is the game?
  answer: > 
  Special introductory price is only P399 per head. Hurry, book now while the offer is still valid. For Wicked Webinar and Train to Busan, it's 599. 

- question: Are there specific time slots? Can we play during a weekend? Can you host a late night game?
answer: > 
There are no specific time slots. As long as there are no schedule conflicts and our moderator is free, we can accommodate your group.

- question: What do we need to play? Can I play on mobile?
answer: > 
Each participant needs to be able to log-in to Zoom with a stable video and audio connection. You can play through mobile or desktop, although desktop is recommended.

- question: We don’t have Zoom. Can we do it via other apps?
answer: > 
We highly encourage using Zoom because some of its functionalities are needed for the game play. It’s free to make an account and download the app. However, if for some reason your group prefers to use other video calling apps, send us a PM via Mystery Manila’s FB page so we can test it out.
